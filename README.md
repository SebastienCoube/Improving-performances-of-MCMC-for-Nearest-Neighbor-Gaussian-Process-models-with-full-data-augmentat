 - The folder R_scripts gathers the immplementation of the methods that are presented in the article. 
 
 - Vignette.md is a step-by-step explanation of how to use the scripts on a toy example. The codes can be scrapped from the original Vignette.rmd 
 
 - The folder Heavy_metals contains the heavy metal data and the script we used for the article, but not the heavy MCMC chains.
